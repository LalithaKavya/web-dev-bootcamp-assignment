	<p>In a big beautiful palace there lived an old king who fell very sick one day. He had many servants and among them was a good servant Jose who had won the king s heart. The king thought that he was lying on his death-bedâ€¦so he said, "Let faithful Jose come to me."
	Faithful Jose was his affectionate servant and was called so because he had been true to him all his lifetime. As soon as Jose came to the bedside, the king said, "My faithful Jose. I feel that my end approaches and I am worried about my son who is still so young that he cannot always guide himself aright. If you do not promise to instruct him in everything he ought to know and be his guardian, I cannot close my eyes in peace."
